# Hellfire Lemonade: Quench Your Infernal Thirst

## Unholy Ingredients

- 6 blood-red lemons (regular yellow ones will suffice in desperate times)
- 666g of crystallized suffering (or sugar if you're out)
- Tears of the innocent (filtered water works too)
- A dash of brimstone (cayenne pepper for the non-initiated)

## Ritual Instructions

1. Sacrifice the lemons by squeezing them into the chalice of refreshment
2. Invoke the sweetening spirits by dissolving the crystallized suffering
3. Cast in the tears of the innocent and stir counterclockwise
4. Add brimstone to taste - the more pain, the more pleasure
5. Serve over ice harvested from the coldest circle of Hell
6. Consume while contemplating the delightfully sinful balance of sweet and sour

*Remember: A refreshed Satanist is an effective Satanist. Hail Hydration! ðŸ¤˜*
